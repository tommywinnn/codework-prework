## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
Favorite Applications
1. MyFitnessPal
2. Calorie Counter
3. Youtube

A feature of both MyFitnessPal and Calorie Counter that I enjoy is that you are able to scan the labels of a food product, and it will find the macros for the food item.

A feature of Youtube that I love is that you can hover over a video and it will play, and you can choose to have sound on or off.

## Notes

One of the challenges that I have encountered while building the app is locating the areas. I had to spend more time to get familar with Xcode.
